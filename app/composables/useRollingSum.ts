/**
 * useRollingSum
 *
 * The rolling-sum primitive powering both the HoursToLimit chart and the 4
 * LimitCards. Per brief §3.2:
 *
 *   For each date D in the displayed 15-day window (today-7 ... today+7):
 *     Y(D) = sum of flightHours[].hours where date is in
 *            (D - windowDays + 1) ... D inclusive
 *
 * Rules verified against mock-flight-hours.json's `chartBounds`:
 *   - Display window is ALWAYS ±7 days from today regardless of toggle
 *   - Only `windowDays` (the summation width) changes per toggle:
 *       1w → 7, 1m → 30, 3m → 90, 6m → 180, 1y → 365
 *
 * Dates use UTC midnight normalization (mirrors useDocumentExpiry) so DST
 * boundaries don't shift the day count.
